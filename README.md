Designed by Mohammad Norouzi

1. _We will make a lot of modules as a PHP file. But on per request will load one or maximum 5 child modules_
2. _If you have the experience, you can make preload modules._
3. _many "include" files will replace on release version (automatically)_
4. _This Framework is suited for small teams that want to make easy scalable projects_
5. _You can't add functions inside modules. either Do procedural programming or make a function on CPU/fn.php and use functional_
