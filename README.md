Designed by Mohammad Norouzi

1. _It's up to you how to make modules. Complete Client-side render without knowing javascript OR half client-side render._
2. _We will make a lot of modules as a PHP file. But on per request will load one or maximum 5 child modules._
3. _If you have the experience, you can make preload modules.(Client-side render)_
4. _many "include" files will replace on release version (automatically)_
5. _This Framework is suited for small teams that want to make easy scalable projects_
6. _You can't add functions inside modules. either Do procedural programming or make a function on CPU/fn.php and use functional_
7. _All existing modules are an example and are not part of the framework_
